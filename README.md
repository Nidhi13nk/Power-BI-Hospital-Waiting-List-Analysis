# Power-BI-Hospital-Waiting-List-Analysis
## 1. Understanding the Problem
Hospitals have long waiting lists for different types of patients. Management wants to analyze these waitlists to improve efficiency.

The key goals of this project are:
* Track the current number of patients on the waitlist.
* Analyze monthly trends in Inpatient and Outpatient categories.
* Understand the waitlist for different medical specialties and age groups.
* Calculate the average and median wait times.
* Find the total number of patients waiting.

## 2. Data Collection
I received healthcare data which includes 8 CSV files (4 for Inpatients, 4 for Outpatients) covering data from January 2018 to March 2021.

Types of Patients:
* Outpatients: Visit for a short consultation or procedure.
* Inpatients: Stay in the hospital for one or more nights.
* Day Cases: Patients who come for a procedure but go home the same day.

Each dataset includes:
* Archive Date: Date of the record.
* Specialty: Medical department the patient is waiting for.
* Case Type: Whether the patient is an Outpatient, Inpatient, or Day Case.
* Age Profile: Age group of the patient.
* Time Bands: How long the patient has been waiting.
